# **Course Overview**

**Humanitarians AI — Virtual Environments and Real-Time 3D** is a community-built open course teaching the fundamentals and advanced techniques behind real-time 3D graphics, virtual environments, digital worlds, and interactive simulations.

Volunteers learn by **building small games, tools, simulations, shaders, materials, animations, VFX systems, VR/AR prototypes, and real-time applications**, using both **Unity** and **Unreal Engine**.

This course combines:

* Real-time 3D programming
* Game engine subsystems (rendering, physics, collisions, audio, triggers)
* Virtual & augmented reality
* Mobile and networked game development
* Basic game AI
* Game analytics
* Generative AI tools for 2D, 3D, audio, and animation

The course evolves through hands-on labs, community-created demos, and updates via GitHub and the **Humanitarians Courses GPT** assistant.

# **Course Structure & Pedagogy**

All Humanitarians AI courses follow the **Learn → Build → Teach** model:

1. **Start with an Outline**
   Volunteers draft and refine the structure of each module.

2. **Build Labs & Prototypes First**
   Each module includes:

   * Engine walkthroughs
   * Mini-projects
   * Code skeletons
   * Real-time demos

3. **Use Humanitarians Courses GPT**
   Volunteers generate:

   * Slides
   * Lecture scripts
   * Hands-on guides
   * Visual backfills

4. **Record YouTube Lessons**
   Short, modular lessons (3–12 minutes each).

5. **Continuous Updating**
   New volunteers contribute new shaders, assets, labs, and demos.
